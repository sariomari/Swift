## Running instructions
We used visual studio code for our program , we downloaded the app with all the necessary libraries and downloaded React Native, we used expo and expoGo to check the output of the code , we also downloaded Django to work on the backend part and the required libraries to connect between the frontend and the backend as well as getting the exact location of the customer and the time of the order ( our code is javascript for the frontend and Django for the backend).

## structure of the project
The structure of the project: the first folder is “myapp” which is the driver’s application frontend , while the second folder “myapp1” is the customer’s application frontend , “playground” is the backend application for both “myapp1” and “myapp” and the “swiftbackend” is the settings and files for the backend , In “myapp” there is the screens folders where there is the signup and login pages and you can also find “deliverymain” which is the screen with the map and where you get the tasks , in “deliverymain” there is a lot of fetch functions that are basically the way to communicate with the backend , in “playground” there is “views.py” which is a file that has all the functions used in our product and the “models.py” there is the definition for all the tables and how they are in the database .In “myapp1” in addition to the screens there is an assets folder that it has all the pictures and the fonts.
